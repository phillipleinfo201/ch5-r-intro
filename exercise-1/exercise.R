# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

home <- PUYALLUP

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`

myname <- Phillip

# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`

myheight <- "5'8"

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

puppy <- 1

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is

puppyprice <- 500

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

puppytotal <- 500

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000

puppyexpensive <- puppytotal > 1000

# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the nuber of puppies you can afford for $1K.

maxpuppies <- 2
